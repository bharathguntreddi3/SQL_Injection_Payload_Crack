hashlib - The hashlib module defines an API for accessing different cryptographic hashing algorithms.

HASH Algorithms:
    1.md5
    2.sha1
    3.sha224
    4.sha256
    5.sha384
    6.sha512

MD5 Algorithm : md5 algorithm is the old algorithm for password cracking using their hashes and a hash generator

SHA Algorithm : SHA algorithm is the latest and most powerfull and secure algorithm for password cracking using thier hashes and generating hashes

import hashlib   # for accessing the functionalities of the hashlib library to crack passwords using thier hashes
